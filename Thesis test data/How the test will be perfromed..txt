What tests will be performed?

- Each method will be tested separately.
- Each method will be tested against the 30fps and 60fps target.
- Each method fps test will be run using the normal trees, dense trees and extra dense trees scene settings.
- Each test will be started at the Very-high preset.
- This totals 6 tests for each method, for a total of 12 tests.
- Test results will be collected to an exel table and analyzed later on this chapter.

Test process:
1. Start the application.
2. Select the tree amount, which it either Normal Trees, Dense Trees or Extra Dense Trees depending on the test.
3. Select the Graphics menu.
4. Change the setting to the Very High preset.
5. Press the Apply Settings button. 
6. Select the ABOT menu.
7. Set the correct frame rate which is either 30 or 60 depending on the test.
8. Start the test.
9. Waith for the test to run.
10. Close the application to ensure that the settings will be clean on repeated tests.
11. Move the data from the "ABOT Performance Data.text" file to an excel table.

The previous will be repeated for each test.
The reason for closing the application between tests is reset its values.
