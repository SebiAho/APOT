This Unity project was made to test the possibility of automating the setting adjustment in a computer program.
This was done to gather test data for my thesis "Automatic optimization of program settings for performance".

The project was done with "Unity version: 2021.3.8f1"
and "Visual Studio version: 2019".

The project is explained more in dept at chapter 4 of said thesis.

It needs to be noted that due to time constraints, the code was written mostly with the goal of "just get it to work".
Comnbined with a lack of plans or need for further further development, means that the code can be a bit messy in parts.

The project uses free Unity Store asset "Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene" for graphics.
While the scene includes some of its own code, this isn't used within the test code itself outside  possible graphical effects).
The asset  isin`t included with the project due to the storage limits on a GitHub account.

The folder "Assets/Scripts" contains code written specifically for the project.
The folder "Project pictures" contains screenshots from the project and the code.
The folder "Project test data" contains information about the tests performed witht the project and the test data itself.
